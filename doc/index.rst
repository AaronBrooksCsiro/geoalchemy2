GeoAlchemy 2
============

GeoAlchemy 2 is a rewrite of GeoAlchemy (version1). GeoAlchemy 2 aims to be
simpler, in terms of both usage and maintaince. GeoAlchemy 2 uses SQLAlchemy's
most recent features, and aims to work well with what will become SQLAlchemy
1.0.

GeoAlchemy 2 aims to support PostGIS 2. There's currently no plan to support
other spatial databases, like Oracle Locator/Spatial. Please contact us if you
want to add, and maintain, support for other spatial databases in GeoAlchemy 2!
