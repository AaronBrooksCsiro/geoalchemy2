GeoAlchemy 2 Documentation
==========================

*Using SQLAlchemy with Spatial Databases.*

GeoAlchemy 2 aims to be simpler than its predecessor, in terms of both usage,
and maintainance. GeoAlchemy 2 uses SQLAlchemy's most recent features, and aims
to work well with, and fully benefit from, what will be SQLAlchemy 1.0.

GeoAlchemy 2's current target is PostGIS 2. There's currently no plan to
support other spatial databases, like Oracle Locator/Spatial. But please
contact us if you want to add, and maintain, support for other spatial
databases in GeoAlchemy 2.

The code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/geoalchemy/geoalchemy2.
